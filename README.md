# A python - driven approach to creating music exercises

This repository contains script to create [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) decks using [GenAnki](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki/) that contain exercises that I find useful when trying to vary my studying.

The scripts create exercise anki APKG files that you then can import into your Anki client and for example do 2 of each deck for 10min every day.

Suggestions for new exercise combinations are welcome.

Enjoy!
